# ![img](./diamonds.jpg)
# %% [markdown]
# In this lab we are going to work with data to understand the characteristics of a diamond that are most likely to influence its price. In this first part of the lab, we will explore and clean our data. 
# 
# The dataset we will be using is comprised of approximately 54k rows and 11 different columns. As always, a row represents a single observation (in this case a diamond) and each of the columns represent a different feature of a diamond.
# 
# The following codebook was provided together with the dataset to clarify what each column represents:
# 
# %% [markdown]
# | Column  | Description  |
# |---|---|
# | Price  | Price in US dollars (326-18,823)  |
# | Carat  | Weight of the diamond (0.2--5.01)  |
# | Cut  | Quality of the cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal)  |
# | Color  | Diamond colour, from J (worst) to D (best)  |
# | Clarity  | A measurement of how clear the diamond is (I1 (worst), SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, IF (best))   |
# | x  | Length in mm (0--10.74)  |
# | y  | Width in mm (0--58.9)  |
# | z  | Depth in mm (0--31.8)  |
# | Depth  | Total depth percentage = z / mean(x, y) = 2 * z / (x + y) (43--79)  |
# | Table  | Width of top of diamond relative to widest point (43--95)  |
# %% [markdown]
# ## Libraries
# Pandas and numpy will be needed for the analysis of the data. Don't worry about the seaborn and matplotlib import at the moment, you will learn more about them next week, but we will be using some of their functionalities.

# %%
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# %% [markdown]
# First import the data from the .csv file provided and assign it to a variable named `diamonds` and drop the column with the index.

# %%
diamonds = pd.read_csv('/Users/bert/Desktop/dataV2-labs/module-2/M2-mini-project1/diamonds.csv').drop(['Unnamed: 0'], axis=1)

#.drop(['Unnamed: 0'], axis=1) --> this remove the column with the index. 
diamonds.head(10)

# %% [markdown]
# # 1. Taking the first look at the data.
# Let's see how the data looks by using pandas methods like `head()`, `info()` and `describe()`. 
# 
# **First, use the `head` method.**

# %%
diamonds.head()

# %% [markdown]
# We can see the first 5 rows of the dataset using the `head` method. This by itself doesn't tell us much about the data that we have, but we can have a first look at the features (columns) and some of the values that each one takes.
# 
# **What do you see? Make some comments about the values you see in each column, comparing them with the codebook. Is that what you would expect for these variables?**

# %%
'''
* We can see for each diamond the carat of the stone (= weight of the diamond) with min. (0.2 & max 5.01) --> here we have small diamonds
* Here we can also see how's the cut of the diamond is? (5 index columns where Ideal is the best and Premium second best. and good is just average.) If we only look to these 5 we have pretty good quality of diamonds. 
* The color is also important here we have 2 not so good qualities and 3 very good qualties just under the best quality. 
    (J --> D) --> D is the best quality and J is the worst!
* Clarity of these 5 stones is not so good if take a look to the codebook. We can say that those stones are average.  
* Depth: 
* Table: 
* Price: price of a diamond depends on a combination of several things. (Carat, Cut, Color, Clarity, Depth and Table)
* X: This represents the length of the diamond in mm of these 5 the range is between 3.89 and 4.34
* Y: This represenets the width of the diamond in mm of these 5 the range is between 3.84 and 4.45
* Z: This represents the depth of the diamond in mm of these 5 the range is between 2.31 and 2.75 

Was I expect thse variables? 
I would expect there was a larger difference in the price range. 
I was also expecting to see a relation between the values  Y in comparison with Table but at first glance we don't see much. 
I also thought that on the basis of 5 records, it was impossible to draw a conclusion.

# 
# For instance, if we have a column that is a `date` with a `string` format, we will have the data but we won't be able to do a simple operation, such as format the date the way that we would like.

# You have probably noticed that the columns x, y and z have a minimum value of 0. This means that there are one or more rows (or observations) in our dataset that are supposedly representing a diamond that has lenght, width or depth of 0. Considering that we're talking about a physical object, this is impossible!
# 
# Now let's proceed to check the rows that have a value of 0 in any of the x, y or z columns. By doing this we want to check if the data we are missing can be obtained using the data that we do have.
# 
# **Check the columns with `x`, `y` and `z` with value 0 in all of them and comment what you see**

# x = 8 --> Everywhere where x == 0 z is also == 0 but there is one value where y has value
# y = 7 --> Everywhere where y == 0 also x & z == 0 
# z = 20 --> sometimes there is a value for x & y where z is equal to 0

# %% [markdown]
# As you can see, we have 20 rows that have a value of 0 in some or all the aforementioned columns.
# Most of them (12) are missing the z value, which we can obtain using the columns depth, x and y. 
# 
# 20 rows with issues represent just 0.03% of our data (20 out of 53940) so it wouldn't be a big deal to remove them. Still, lets try to keep all the data we have. 
# 
# For those 12 rows, we will create a function that applies the formula given in the codebook and get the value of z. We will drop the other rows (8), since they are missing all 3 values or 2 of them.
# 
# **Create a function named `calculate_z` that applies the function in the codebook to one single row you give to the function**

# If we leave the other 8 values as they are, it would negatively affect our analysis, because these are data that do not make logical sense. Therefore it is better to consider those values as NaN values, since they are probably the result of a mistake or error during process of measuring and storing these values in a dataset.
# 
# To replace them we can use the pandas .replace() method and np.NaN.
# 
# **Replace the zero values in the `z` column for a NaN**

# # Bonus: check the new z values
# Since we need to be 100% sure of our data, let's create a function that validates our z. To do so, we will use the same formula, but this time we will calculate the value of depth with the new value assigned to z.
# 
# **Create a function named `validate_z` that compares the `z`  in cells above with the one thrown by the formula and run it with the rows you changed in the cells above**

# Let's check the data again with the `describe()` method.

# The minimum value for x, y and z should now be a positive number, as it should be for the physical measurements of an object.
# %% [markdown]
# Let's finish by checking for NaN values in the data. Since we introduced them ourselves using 'replace', we will surely find some, but there may be more that are unrelated to the x, y and z columns. Checking NaNs is a fundamental part of data cleaning and it's always better to do this kind of operations before proceeding with analysis.

# **Check how many NaNs do you have, comment what you would do with those values, and then do so**

# Now we are going to revisit the summary table to check for outliers.

#Min in x, y, z is not 0 anymore. 
#Price label has a very large standard variation. 

# %% [markdown]
# To manage these outliers, we are going to filter our DataFrame, we're going to take all the values that have a price higher than the 75th percentile.
# 
# **Look for that quantile and filter the dataframe to clearly see the outliers. What do you think?**

# Our dataset is really big and the outliers are really far apart from the rest of the values. To see this more clearly we will use a boxplot, which plots the median, 25th and 75th quartile, the maximum and minimum, as well as any outliers.

#Run this code
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1,2, figsize=(10, 5))

# Now we can see that all the values are within an acceptable range, but we have 2 big outliers in y and 1 in z. Now we know that our max values for y should be around 10 and the values for z should be around 6, so let's filter our dataset to find values higher than 10 in it.
# 

# %%

diamonds2_filter

# %% [markdown]
# Now that we have found the outlier, let's use the function we defined earlier to correct this value. First, we need to change the value to 0 (because that's how we defined the function before) and then we will apply it.

# **Apply `calculate_z` for the row with the outlier**

# %%
diamonds2.loc[48410,'z']=0

diamonds2['z'] = diamonds2.apply(lambda row: calculate_z(row), axis=1)

# %% [markdown]
# Let's check if we actually corrected the outlier.

# %%
diamonds2.loc[48410]

# %% [markdown]
# Cool! Now let's validate our new `z`. We will check if we obtain the same value of depth using our validate function. If the formula applies, this means could approximate the real value of `z`.
# 
# **Apply `validate_z` to the row used earlier**

# %%
#your code here

# %% [markdown]
# Now let's do the same for `y`. First, let's filter the DataFrame to find the outliers. We said that the maximum values should be around 10, so let's check what are the values above 10.
# 
# **Check the values greater than 10 in the `y` column**

# 
# **Create a function named `calculate_y` to calculate `y` using `z` and `x` the same way you did above**

# %%
def calculate_y2 (row):
    if row['y'] > 0: 
        return row['y']
    elif row['y'] == 0 and row['x'] != 0 and row['z'] != 0:
        num1 = row['z']*200
        num2 = row['x']*row['depth']
        num3 = num1 - num2 
        num4 = num3/row['depth']
        return num4

diamonds2['y'] = diamonds2.apply(lambda row: calculate_y2(row), axis=1)


# %%
var_one = diamonds2.loc[24067,'y']
var_two = diamonds2.loc[49189,'y']

# %% [markdown]
# We will check the rows that had an outlier in `y`, to check that the values were changed.
# 
# **Check those rows (also validating with your function) and comment what you see**
# %% [markdown]
# Now that we have corrected or dropped all of our outliers, lets plot another box plot to double check.

# %%
#Run this code
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1,2, figsize=(10, 5))

# **What do you think? Are these values more reasonable?**
# 

# %%
#Indeed it make more sense and the readability is better than in the previous. 
#We can see more clear through the dataset and se better the distribution. 
#Personally I would choose for another boxplot that have better readability. (Pxplot)
