## Project Description
Safety in Amsterdam (Centrum). I had the question "Why do I feel myself sometimes unsafe at night?". 
Then I started to dive in the datasets of Amsterdam to retrieve an answer. 

Because we are limit in time my research only holds on the next topics: 
- population 
- different nationalities 
- Kind of crimes
- Total crimes


## Organization
I used Trello to track down my process. It's useful to see where you are at a certain point in your project. 
Besides Trello I also used Excel to make the basic graph and Jupyter notebook to retrieve the data from the CSV files

Repository: 
- .gitignore file
- .ReadMe file
- Jupyternote book files 
- Data sets
- Foto's
